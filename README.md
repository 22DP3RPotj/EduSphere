# **Learning Platform: Detailed Project Description**

This document outlines the detailed functionality, architecture, and project logic for the Learning Platform. It is designed to address potential questions and guide the development process.

---

## **1. Project Overview**

The Learning Platform is a web application where:

- **Teachers** can create, manage, and deliver courses.

- **Students** can browse, enroll in, and access course materials.

### **Core Features**

1. User roles with distinct permissions (Teachers, Students, Admin).

2. Secure user authentication and profile management.

3. Course creation, editing, publishing, and enrollment management.

4. Search and filtering for courses.

5. Role-based access to course content and features.

6. An admin panel for platform management.

---

## **2. Application Logic**

### **2.1. User Roles and Permissions**

#### **Teachers**

- Can create, edit, and delete courses.

- Can view and manage the list of students enrolled in their courses.

- Can upload course materials (e.g., text, PDFs, video links).

- Can publish/unpublish courses (unpublished courses are not visible to students).

#### **Students**

- Can browse all published courses available on the platform.

- Can enroll in free or paid courses (optional payment system in future phases).

- Can access course materials after enrollment.

- Can manage their enrolled courses and track progress (e.g., completed modules).

#### **Admins**

- Have access to a dashboard for user management (e.g., banning users, approving teachers).

- Can moderate courses to ensure compliance with platform policies.

- Can manage platform settings (e.g., categories, featured courses).

---

### **2.2. Course Management**

#### **Course Properties**

- **Title**: A brief name for the course.

- **Description**: A detailed explanation of the course.

- **Category**: A classification (e.g., Science, Arts, Technology).

- **Teacher**: The creator of the course.

- **Materials**: Resources such as PDFs, videos, and links.

- **Publish Status**: Determines if the course is visible to students.

#### **Logic for Visibility**

- Students can see only **published courses**.

- Unpublished courses are visible only to the teacher who created them and to admins.

#### **Course Enrollment**

- Students must explicitly enroll in a course to access its materials.

- A course can have a maximum capacity (optional future feature).

---

### **2.3. Search and Filtering**

- **Search**: Students can search courses by title or keywords in the description.

- **Filters**:

  - By category (e.g., Science, Technology).

  - By teacher name.

  - By popularity (number of students enrolled).

---
### **2.4. Access Control**

#### **Public Access**

- Any visitor (not logged in) can view the platform's homepage and browse the list of published courses.

- Enrollment and material access require login.

#### **Private Access**

- Students and teachers have personalized dashboards:

  - **Students**: A list of enrolled courses, progress tracking.

  - **Teachers**: A list of their courses, with options to manage them.

#### **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**

- Certain endpoints are restricted based on user roles.

  - Example: Only teachers can create courses, only students can enroll in courses.

---

### **2.5. Notifications (Optional)**

- Notify students via email or on the dashboard when:

  - New content is added to an enrolled course.

  - Their enrollment request is approved (if manual approval is required).

- Notify teachers when:

  - A new student enrolls in their course.

---

### **2.6. Platform Moderation**

- Admins can:

  - View and remove courses flagged as inappropriate.

  - Manage user roles (e.g., approve teacher accounts).

  - Update global settings (e.g., platform title, featured courses).

---

## **3. Development Architecture**

### **3.1. Backend**

- Framework: **Django**.

- **Authentication**: Role-based authentication using either session-based authentication or JWT.

- **Database**: PostgreSQL.

#### **Backend APIs**

- User management:

  - Signup, login, and profile management.

- Course management:

  - CRUD operations for courses.

  - APIs for searching, filtering, and enrolling.

- Enrollment:

  - API for students to enroll in courses and view their enrolled courses.

- Admin panel:

  - APIs for moderation and user role management.

---

### **3.2. Frontend**

- Framework: **Vue.js**.

- **Key Pages**:

  - Home: List of courses with search and filters.

  - Course Details: Information about a specific course, with an "Enroll" button.

  - Profile: User details and enrolled courses.

  - Dashboard: Separate views for teachers and students.

---

### **3.3. Database Design**

| **Table**       | **Fields**                                                                              | **Description**                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **User**        | ID, username, email, password, role (teacher/student/admin), bio, profile picture       | Stores user credentials and roles.              |
| **Course**      | ID, title, description, category, teacher_id (FK), is_published, created_at, updated_at | Stores course information.                      |
| **Enrollment**  | ID, course_id (FK), student_id (FK), enrolled_at                                        | Links students to courses they are enrolled in. |
| **Material**    | ID, course_id (FK), title, type (text/PDF/video), file_path, created_at                 | Stores uploaded materials for a course.         |

## **4. Questions Answered**

1. **Can students see all courses on the platform?**

   - Students can see only **published courses**.

   - Unpublished courses are visible only to their respective teachers and admins.

2. **How are teachers and students separated?**

   - User roles (teacher/student/admin) are defined at registration or by an admin.

   - Backend logic restricts access to features based on roles.

3. **Can students enroll in multiple courses?**

   - Yes, students can enroll in as many courses as they like.

4. **How do teachers manage their courses?**

   - Teachers access a dashboard where they can:

     - View a list of their courses.

     - Create, edit, and delete courses.

     - Upload and manage materials.

5. **How are categories defined?**

   - Categories are predefined by the admin but can be extended dynamically.

6. **Are there any limits on file uploads?**

   - File upload limits will depend on server configuration (e.g., 50 MB per file).

---

## **5. Deployment Strategy**

1. **Backend**: Deploy Django with Gunicorn and NGINX on a VPS (e.g., DigitalOcean, Linode).

2. **Frontend**: Host the Vue.js app on Netlify or Vercel for cost-effective deployment.

3. **Database**: Use a managed PostgreSQL instance or host it on the same VPS.

---

## **6. Future Enhancements**

1. **Payment Gateway Integration**:

   - Add support for paid courses using Stripe or PayPal.

2. **Course Ratings and Reviews**:

   - Allow students to rate courses and leave feedback.

3. **Progress Tracking**:

   - Implement a feature to track module completion within a course.

4. **Mobile App**:

   - Build a mobile version using frameworks like React Native or Flutter.
