# **Course Marketplace Platform: Detailed Project Description**  
This document outlines the functionality, architecture, and logic for the Course Marketplace Platform, enabling creators to monetize content and learners to engage via real-time communication.

---

## **1. Project Overview**  
The platform is a **course marketplace** where:  
- **Creators** (any registered user) can design, publish, and sell courses.  
- **Learners** can discover, purchase, and interact with courses and creators.  
- **Admins** manage platform operations, commissions, and moderation.  

### **Core Features**  
1. **Open Course Creation**: Any user can create and sell courses (free or paid).  
2. **Real-Time Communication**: Integrated chat, direct messaging, and course Q&A.  
3. **Monetization & Commissions**: Platform earns a percentage of paid course sales.  
4. Role-based access (Creator, Learner, Admin) with flexible permissions.  
5. Course discovery with advanced search, filters, and recommendations.  
6. Admin dashboard for financial tracking, user moderation, and dispute resolution.

## **2. Application Logic**  

### **2.1. User Roles and Permissions**  
#### **Creators**  
- Create, edit, and publish courses (free or paid).  
- Set course prices and manage earnings (post-commission).  
- Interact with learners via chat and course discussions.  
- View sales analytics and learner engagement metrics.  

#### **Learners**  
- Browse, purchase, and enroll in courses.  
- Access purchased courses and participate in discussions.  
- Message creators and other learners.  
- Rate courses and leave public reviews.  

#### **Admins**  
- Approve/reject courses to ensure quality and compliance.  
- Manage commissions (e.g., set rates, view transaction history).  
- Moderate chats, resolve disputes, and suspend accounts.  

---

### **2.2. Course Management**  
#### **Course Properties**  
- **Price**: Free or set amount (with platform commission).  
- **Status**: Draft, Under Review (admin approval), Published.  
- **Materials**: Videos, PDFs, quizzes, and discussion boards.  
- **Earnings**: Track revenue (after commission) in creator dashboard.  

#### **Commission Logic**  
- Admins set global commission rates (e.g., 15% per sale).  
- Creators receive earnings post-commission, withdrawable via Stripe/PayPal.  

---

### **2.3. Real-Time Communication**  
- **Course Chat**: Public chat rooms for enrolled learners.  
- **Direct Messaging**: Private conversations between users.  
- **Notifications**: Alerts for new messages, sales, and course updates.

### **2.4. Search and Filtering**  
- **Filters**: Price (free/paid), ratings, category, creator.  
- **Sorting**: Trending (engagement), newest, highest-rated.  

---

### **2.5. Access Control**  
- **Public Access**: Browse courses without an account.  
- **Private Access**:  
  - Purchases and messaging require login.  
  - Creators control course visibility (draft/published).  
- **RBAC**:  
  - Admins approve courses and manage payouts.  
  - Learners cannot edit courses; creators cannot moderate others.  

---

### **2.6. Payments & Payouts**  
- **Stripe/PayPal Integration**: Handle purchases and creator withdrawals.  
- **Escrow System**: Hold earnings until course completion (configurable).  

---

## **3. Development Architecture**  

### **3.1. Backend**  
- **Framework**: Django + Django Channels (WebSocket support).  
- **Authentication**: JWT with OAuth2 for social logins.  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Redis (for real-time features).  

#### **APIs**  
- **Course & Payment**: CRUD, purchase, commission calculation.  
- **Chat**: WebSocket endpoints for messaging and notifications.  
- **Admin**: Payout management, dispute resolution, analytics.

### **3.2. Frontend**  
- **Framework**: React.js (Next.js for SSR) + Tailwind CSS.  
- **Key Pages**:  
  - **Creator Dashboard**: Course stats, earnings, chat inbox.  
  - **Marketplace**: Course listings with filters and recommendations.  
  - **Chat Interface**: Real-time messaging with message history.

| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |  
| **User**          | ID, email, role, stripe_account_id, balance, created_at                    |  
| **Course**        | ID, title, price, commission_rate, status (draft/published), creator_id   |  
| **Enrollment**    | ID, course_id, learner_id, purchased_at, payment_status                   |  
| **Message**       | ID, sender_id, receiver_id, content, timestamp, is_read                   |
